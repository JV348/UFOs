# Preparing UFO Information With HTML & JS

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was to establish a webpage that could display information regarding UFO's - in a manner that could be manipulated by incoming users. Our associate has tasked us with modifying the page further, so that multiple filters can be applied to the available data. 

## Results
At first glance, the webpage gives the user a simple yet immersive introduction to the ongoing mystery surrounding UFO sightings. Upon further inspection, one can utilize the webpage's features by scrolling to the left-side column containing the filters, along with their respective input rows. The user must type in the information that they are looking for - otherwise default parameters are returned.

At the request of our associate, we removed the button that had been present in the previous iteration of app.js, and incorporated more filters for any interested users. These filters included: city, state, country, and shape. 

## Summary
As mentioned in the module, Javascript is case sensitive, and, generally speaking, sensitive to all errors. The developer must take care not to mess up any data and actively monitor for consistent syntax - as well as pay attention to proper code structure. On the user's end, one must be careful to have typed in the filter search as it was found in the dataset - therefore, the user must input "ar" and not "AR" as one would normally find in other websites. 

We were aware that the associate requested the removal of the previous button and so we executed that task. However, we feel that future users may wish to visually apply and execute filters on their own (particularly the elderly demographic). As such, there may still be a need for that button. We also believe there ought to be an effort to create a popdown list for each filter search row that contains all possible search parameters. This would make it much easier for those that are unfamiliar with the data table and the possible values that can be searched for. 

Overall, the webpage remains a neat data source for those that are interested in the possibility of extraterrestial life.
